PROBLEM:
Digital secure data
==============================
The company Digital Secure Data Transfer Solutions provides data encryption and data sharing services.
Their process uses a key K for encryption when transmitting characters.
To encrypt a character, the character is replaced by the following Kth character with the same case in the English alphabet set. 
The English alphabetical set is considered in a cyclic fashion for the last K characters. Write an algorithm to find the character used to encrypt the given character.

Input Format:
------------
The input consists of a space-separated character and integer â€“ character and key, representing the character to be transmitted, and the key (K), respectively.

Constraints:
-----------
NA

Output Format:
-------------
Print a character representing the encrypted character.
