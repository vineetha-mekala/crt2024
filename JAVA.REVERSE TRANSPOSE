PROBLEM:
Reverse Transpose
================================
There is a treasure full of gold and diamonds. Jack Sparrow successfully reached the cave with his black pearl. 
He is reading a hint on a box that he need to tilt it 90 degree clock wise. But he don't know what to tilt. 
Finally when he reaches the door there is a dial pad. He remember the hint in the box and he opened the box where it has numbers printed in N x N form.
Now he is tilting the same to 90 degree and seeing the numbers. He couldn't see and type on same time. So write a program to print the 2D matrix which will be helpful for him to type easily.

Input Format:
------------
Read size of rows and columns Read elements of matrix

Constraints:
-----------
1<=n<=10^7

Output Format:
-------------
Print the matrix as described above
