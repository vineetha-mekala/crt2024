PROBLEM
Quadrant Selection 1
==================================
There are four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4, as shown in the diagram below:image

For example, the point A, which is at coordinates (12,5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its x and y values are positive, and point B lies in quadrant 2 since its x value is negative and its y value is positive.

Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be 0.

Input Format:
------------
The first line of input contains the integer x.

The second line of input contains the integer y.

Constraints:
-----------
−1000≤ x,y ≤1000 x≠0 y≠0

Output Format:
-------------
Output the quadrant number 1, 2, 3

or 4 for the point (x, y).
