PROBLEM
Kth factor 1
===========================
A positive integer d is said to be a factor of another positive integer N if when N is divided by d, the remainder obtained is zero. 
For example, for number 12, there are 6 factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Every positive integer k has at least two factors, 1 and the number k itself.
Given two positive integers N and K, write a program to print the kth largest factor of N.

Input Format:
------------
The first line of input contains space-separated list of positive integer pairs(N K)

Constraints:
-----------
1 < N < 10000000000. 1 < K < 600

Output Format:
-------------
Print the kth highest factor of N. If N does not have k factors, the output should be 1.

Sample Output 0

4

Explanation 0
==============
N is 12, K is 3.
The factors of 12 are (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)
The highest factor is 12, the second-highest factor is 6 and the third-highest factor is 4.
Hence, the output is 4.
