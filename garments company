PROBLEM:
Garments Company
==========================
The garments company Apparel wishes to open outlets at various locations. 
The company shortlisted several plots in these locations and wishes to select only plots that are square- shaped. 
Write an algorithm to help Apparel find the number of plots that it can select for its outlets.

Input Format:
------------
The first line of the input consists of an integer num0fMots, representing the number of plots shortlisted by the company for outlets (N). 
The second line consists of N space-separated integers – areal, areal, ….., areaN representing the area of the N plots selected for outlets.

Constraints:
-----------
0 < num0fPlots < 10^6 0 < area < 10^6 0 < i < num0fPlots

Output Format:
-------------
Print an integer representing the number of plots that will be selected for outlets.
